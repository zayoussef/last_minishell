Step 1: Implement the Parser
1. Token Identification: Write functions to identify and categorize tokens (>, <, >>, <<).
2. Structure Definitions: Define structures like t_redirection in your header files to store redirection details.
3. Redirection Handling: Implement functions to handle different types of redirections based on the tokens identified.
Step 2: Implement Command Execution
1. File Descriptor Management: Write functions to manage file descriptors based on the redirection type.
2. Process Forking: Implement forking processes to handle command execution in child processes.
3. Pipe Handling: Write functions to handle piping between commands if necessary.
Step 3: Error Handling
1. Implement Error Checks: Ensure that your file opening, closing, and command execution handle errors gracefully.
2. Set Error Messages: Provide clear and informative error messages for failures in redirection or execution.
Step 6: Testing
1. Unit Tests: Write unit tests for each function, especially focusing on edge cases like empty inputs or invalid commands.
2. Integration Tests: Test the integration of parsing and execution to ensure that commands with redirections work as expected.
Step 4: Documentation
1. Code Comments: Add comments to your code explaining the functionality of each part.
2. User Documentation: Write a README file explaining how to set up and run your project, including examples of commands and their expected outputs.
Step 5: Version Control and Backup
1. Commit Changes: Regularly commit your changes to your Git repository with descriptive commit messages.
2. Backup: Consider setting up a remote repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab and push your changes for backup and collaboration.
Step 6: Deployment
1. Compile Your Project: Use a compiler like GCC to compile your project into an executable.
2. Run Tests: Execute your compiled project with various test cases to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
Step 7: Review and Refine
1. Code Review: Have peers review your code for potential improvements or bugs.
2. Refactor: Refactor your code for better efficiency and readability based on feedback.
By following these steps, you can effectively replicate and extend the redirection handling functionality in a new project environment.
